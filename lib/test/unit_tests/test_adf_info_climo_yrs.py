"""
Collection of python unit tests
for "AdfInfo.get_climo_yrs_from_ts".

This is the method that works out the climatology year range when a user runs
ADF against pre-made time series files and gives no years in the config file.
It searches for the first variable in 'diag_var_list' it can find a file for,
trying the configured history stream(s) before the older, looser "any h0
stream" pattern, and looking in the directory itself before recursing into a
nested (GenTS-style) layout.

NOTE: unlike test_adf_file_utils, these tests import adf_info, which pulls in
xarray and (through adf_utils) the rest of the scientific stack.  The ADF unit
test workflow installs only PyYAML and pytest, so they are skipped there and
only run in a full ADF environment.  Moving the search itself into
adf_file_utils would make it testable in CI; that is a bigger change than the
one these tests were written to cover.
