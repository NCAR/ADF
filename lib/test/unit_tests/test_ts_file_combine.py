"""
Collection of python unit tests
for combining time series files into one file.

The MDTF file move writes one file per variable, so a variable split into
consecutive files has to be combined.  Whether that is safe is decided by
"adf_file_utils.ts_files_need_combining", which reads the periods out of the
file names.  These tests check that decision against what xarray actually does
with the files, so the two cannot drift apart: a set the decision calls
combinable must open, and a set it rejects must be one that really would fail.

Getting that wrong ended the whole ADF run rather than one variable, because
the exception was raised where nothing catches it.

NOTE: these tests import xarray, so they are skipped in CI, which installs only
PyYAML and pytest.  The decision itself is tested without xarray in
test_adf_file_utils.py.
