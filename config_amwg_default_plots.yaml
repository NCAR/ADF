#==============================
# config_amwg_default_plots.yaml

# This config file contains the standard set of variables and plots used for
# evaluating CAM simulations in the AMWG working group.

#Currently, if one is on NCAR's Casper or
#Cheyenne machine, then only the diagnostic output
#paths are needed, at least to perform a quick test
#run (these are indicated with "MUST EDIT" comments).
#Running these diagnostics on a different machine,
#or with a different, non-example simulation, will
#require additional modifications.
#
#Config file Keywords:
#--------------------
#
#1.  Using ${xxx} will substitute that text with the
#    variable referenced by xxx. For example:
#
#    cam_case_name: cool_run
#    cam_climo_loc: /some/where/${cam_case_name}
#
#    will set "cam_climo_loc" in the diagnostics package to:
#    /some/where/cool_run
#
#    Please note that currently this will only work if the
#    variable only exists in one location in the file.
#
#2.  Using ${<top_level_section>.xxx} will do the same as
#    keyword 1 above, but specifies which sub-section the
#    variable is coming from, which is necessary for variables
#    that are repeated in different subsections.  For example:
#
#    diag_basic_info:
#      cam_climo_loc:  /some/where/${diag_cam_climo.start_year}
#
#    diag_cam_climo:
#      start_year: 1850
#
#    will set "cam_climo_loc" in the diagnostics package to:
#    /some/where/1850
#
#Finally, please note that for both 1 and 2 the keywords must be lowercase.
#This is because future developments will hopefully use other keywords
#that are uppercase. Also please avoid using periods (".") in variable
#names, as this will likely cause issues with the current file parsing
#system.

#
##==============================
#
# This file doesn't (yet) read environment variables, so the user must
# set this themselves. It is also a good idea to search the doc for 'user'
# to see what default paths are being set for output/working files.
#
# Note that the string 'USER-NAME-NOT-SET' is used in the jupyter script
# to check for a failure to customize
#
user: 'USER-NAME-NOT-SET'


#This first set of variables specify basic info used by all diagnostic runs:
diag_basic_info:

    #History file string to match (eg. cam.h0 or ocn.pop.h.ecosys.nday1)
    # Only affects timeseries as everything else uses timeseries
    # Leave off trailing '.'
    #Default: cam.h0
    hist_str: cam.h0

    #Is this a model vs observations comparison?
    #If "false" or missing, then a model-model comparison is assumed:
    compare_obs: false

    #Generate HTML website (assumed false if missing):
    #Note:  The website files themselves will be located in the path
    #specified by "cam_diag_plot_loc", under the "<diag_run>/website" subdirectory,
    #where "<diag_run>" is the subdirectory created for this particular diagnostics run
    #(usually "case_vs_obs_XXX" or "case_vs_baseline_XXX").
    create_html: true

    #Location of observational datasets:
    #Note: this only matters if "compare_obs" is true and the path
    #isn't specified in the variable defaults file.
    obs_data_loc: /glade/work/nusbaume/SE_projects/model_diagnostics/ADF_obs

    #Location where re-gridded and interpolated CAM climatology files are stored:
    cam_regrid_loc: /glade/scratch/${user}/ADF/regrid

    #Overwrite CAM re-gridded files?
    #If false, or missing, then regridding will be skipped for regridded variables
    #that already exist in "cam_regrid_loc":
    cam_overwrite_regrid: false

    #Location where diagnostic plots are stored:
    cam_diag_plot_loc: /glade/scratch/${user}/ADF/plots

    #Location of ADF variable plotting defaults YAML file:
    #If left blank or missing, ADF/lib/adf_variable_defaults.yaml will be used
    #Uncomment and change path for custom variable defaults file
    #defaults_file: /some/path/to/defaults/file.yaml

    #Vertical pressure levels (in hPa) on which to plot 3-D variables
    #when using horizontal (e.g. lat/lon) map projections.
    #If this config option is missing, then no 3-D variables will be plotted on
    #horizontal maps.  Please note too that pressure levels must currently match
    #what is available in the observations file in order to be plotted in a
    #model vs obs run:
    plot_press_levels: [200,850]

    #Longitude line on which to center all lat/lon maps.
    #If this config option is missing then the central
    #longitude will default to 180 degrees E.
    central_longitude: 180

    #Number of processors on which to run the ADF.
    #If this config variable isn't present then
    #the ADF defaults to one processor.  Also, if
    #you set it to "*" then it will default
    #to all of the processors available on a
    #single node/machine:
    num_procs: 8

    #If set to true, then redo all plots even if they already exist.
    #If set to false, then if a plot is found it will be skipped:
    redo_plot: false


#This second set of variables provides info for the CAM simulation(s) being diagnosed:
diag_cam_climo:

    #Calculate climatologies?
    #If false, the climatology files will not be created:
    calc_cam_climo: true

    #Overwrite CAM climatology files?
    #If false, or not prsent, then already existing climatology files will be skipped:
    cam_overwrite_climo: false

    #Name of CAM case (or CAM run name):
    cam_case_name: b.e20.BHIST.f09_g17.20thC.297_05

    #Case nickname
    #NOTE: if nickname starts with '0' - nickname must be in quotes!
    # ie '026a' as opposed to 026a
    #If missing or left blank, will default to cam_case_name
    case_nickname: #cool nickname

    #Location of CAM history (h0) files:
    #Example test files
    cam_hist_loc: /glade/p/cesm/ADF/${diag_cam_climo.cam_case_name}

    #Location of CAM climatologies (to be created and then used by this script)
    cam_climo_loc: /glade/scratch/${user}/ADF/${diag_cam_climo.cam_case_name}/climo

    #model year when time series files should start:
    #Note:  Leaving this entry blank will make time series
    #       start at earliest available year.
    start_year: 1990

    #model year when time series files should end:
    #Note:  Leaving this entry blank will make time series
    #       end at latest available year.
    end_year: 1999

    #Do time series files exist?
    #If True, then diagnostics assumes that model files are already time series.
    #If False, or if simply not present, then diagnostics will attempt to create
    #time series files from history (time-slice) files:
    cam_ts_done: false

    #Save interim time series files?
    #WARNING:  This can take up a significant amount of space,
       #          but will save processing time the next time
    cam_ts_save: true

    #Overwrite time series files, if found?
    #If set to false, then time series creation will be skipped if files are found:
    cam_overwrite_ts: false

    #Location where time series files are (or will be) stored:
    cam_ts_loc: /glade/scratch/${user}/ADF/${diag_cam_climo.cam_case_name}/ts

    #----------------------

#This third set of variables provide info for the CAM baseline climatologies.
#This only matters if "compare_obs" is false:
diag_cam_baseline_climo:

    #Calculate cam baseline climatologies?
    #If false, the climatology files will not be created:
    calc_cam_climo: true

    #Overwrite CAM climatology files?
    #If false, or not present, then already existing climatology files will be skipped:
    cam_overwrite_climo: false

    #Name of CAM baseline case:
    cam_case_name: b.e20.BHIST.f09_g16.20thC.125.02

    #Baseline case nickname
    #NOTE: if nickname starts with '0' - nickname must be in quotes!
    # ie '026a' as opposed to 026a
    #If missing or left blank, will default to cam_case_name
    case_nickname: #cool nickname

    #Location of CAM baseline history (h0) files:
    #Example test files
    cam_hist_loc: /glade/p/cesm/ADF/${diag_cam_baseline_climo.cam_case_name}

    #Location of baseline CAM climatologies:
    cam_climo_loc: /glade/scratch/${user}/ADF/${diag_cam_baseline_climo.cam_case_name}/climo

    #model year when time series files should start:
    #Note:  Leaving this entry blank will make time series
    #       start at earliest available year.
    start_year: 1990

    #model year when time series files should end:
    #Note:  Leaving this entry blank will make time series
    #       end at latest available year.
    end_year: 1999

    #Do time series files need to be generated?
    #If True, then diagnostics assumes that model files are already time series.
    #If False, or if simply not present, then diagnostics will attempt to create
    #time series files from history (time-slice) files:
    cam_ts_done: false

    #Save interim time series files for baseline run?
    #WARNING:  This can take up a significant amount of space:
    cam_ts_save: true

    #Overwrite baseline time series files, if found?
    #If set to false, then time series creation will be skipped if files are found:

#This fourth set of variables provides settings for calling the Climate Variability
# Diagnostics Package (CVDP). If cvdp_run is set to true the CVDP will be set up and
# run in background mode, likely completing after the ADF has completed.
# If CVDP is to be run PSL, TREFHT, TS and PRECT (or PRECC and PRECL) should be listed
